jQuery Templating Plugin
===============================================================================

This assembly provides access to jQuery Templating plugin APIs. This is only meant
for use at development time, so you can reference and compile your c# code against
the plugin APIs. You must include the appropriate plugin scripts in your page for
runtime functionality.

More information is on http://api.jquery.com/category/plugins/templates/.
